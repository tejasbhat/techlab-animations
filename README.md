# Techlab Animations
JAVA animations made for techlab during summer internship.

These animations range from sorting to Conway's Game of Life, and they are used at [TechLab Education](https://techlab.education) in their online video series. All of the code is well documented and can be easily taught to students in order to expand their knowledge of JAVA.

## Conway Animation

Starts off with a Conway's Game of Life animation and slowly fades into the techlab logo.

## Exploding Circles Animation

Variously colored circles periodocially expand and spawn until the techlab logo appears.
The circles are based off the GrowingItem interface.

## Polygon Animation

Pentagons spin in opposite directions around a centered techlab logo.

## Sorting Animation

Uses different types of sorts to create a gradient of colors before displaying the techlab logo.
